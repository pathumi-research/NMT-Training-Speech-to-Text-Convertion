Create the environment: Run this command in your terminal. Conda will resolve the dependencies and create a new environment named nmt-project-py310:

Bash

conda env create -f environment.yml
Activate the environment:

Bash

conda activate nmt-project-py310
Run the script: Once activated, ensure your nmt_base_local.py script and merged_f.txt data file are in the same folder, and run the script:

Bash

python nmt_base_local.py
This process ensures your project runs with the correct dependencies under a Python 3.10 environment.""""
